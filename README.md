**Food.com Recommender System Data Mining Project**

This project was done during the spring of 2024. 

Its goal was to compare the accuracy of Surprise Package Recommender systems including a baseline model, matrix factorization via SVD, and collaborative filtering model via the K Nearest Neighbors model. It also compared the recommendation systems with a collaborative filtering model developed using Keras. 

The K nearest neighbors model failed to run due to memory issues. 

We utilized user scores for the recommender systems and conducted exploratory analysis on a selection of the variables as well engineered features, including user sentiment. 

We found that the SVD model had the best performance of the two tested Surprise package models. Though, the Surprise models (Baseline, SVD) and the Keras-based collaborative filtering model ultimately both had low accuracy values.
